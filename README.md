# Undertrial
A game I made in Processing in 2020 for CGRA151 at Victoria University.

## Gameplay
Undertrial is a boss-rush inspired by Undertale's combat system. There are 3 bosses to fight, each with different attack patterns. Hit bosses in their weak spot to damage them and eventually defeat them.
